I select Digital consultant as my first choice of position. 
The world is changing rapidly and lots of breakthrough technologies are being developed. 
However, it is hard for clients to catch up with rapid changes and find the most appropriate technology to solve their own problems. 
In this situation, I believe my multicultural background and learning from the major could be utilized to understand clients and deliver the optimum solution with cutting-edge technologies. 
This also fits with my dream of making a better world with technology. 
For these reasons, I want to be a digital consultant.
